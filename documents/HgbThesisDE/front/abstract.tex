    This bachelor's thesis deals with some innovations of \emph{Project Loom} for Java. It examines \emph{virtual threads}, \emph{StructuredTaskScopes} that are also based on virtual threads,
    and \emph{ScopedValues}. For each of these technologies, a technical overview is first provided, discussing how they differ from the already known technologies. 
    This is followed by an explanation of how they can be used in Java, with several examples presented. For \texttt{StructuredTaskScopes}, this also includes integrating custom logic and error handling by
    subclassing the base class. For \texttt{ScopedValues}, the differences compared to \texttt{ThreadLocal} are also addressed. In order to enable a better comparison, performance is also examined. 
    For this purpose, six simple benchmarks that investigate runtime behavior were created and executed. In doing so, the “Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH)” was employed. Due to difficulties in measuring 
    memory consumption, only one test was conducted for this aspect. Each measurement result is accompanied by an analysis. Ultimately, based on the research and the benchmark results, the conclusion provides 
    a summary of the strengths and potential application scenarios.
